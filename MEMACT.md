# Memact Contributor Handoff

Memact is a place where users can finally see what apps know about them.

Apps can bring context. Users decide what stays, what changes, and what gets removed.

The short version:

```text
Apps send context -> Categories shape it -> Wiki lets users control it -> Memory stores what survives
```

## The idea

Most apps build a private version of the user.

They learn from clicks, searches, orders, playlists, watch history, saved items, skipped items, and repeated habits. The user usually cannot see that profile clearly. They cannot clean it up. They cannot move it to another app. They just get whatever personalization the app decides to give them.

Memact flips that.

Apps can propose context, but the user gets a Wiki where that context can be reviewed, edited, rejected, deleted, or shared.

Example:

A music app might notice:

```text
User replayed Brazilian phonk playlists 18 times this month and skipped slow acoustic playlists.
```

The app should not turn that into some hidden permanent profile.

It can propose a readable entry:

```text
Prefers high-energy Brazilian phonk.
```

The user can accept it, reject it, or edit it:

```text
I like Brazilian phonk mostly while working out.
```

That edited user version is stronger than the app guess.

## What contributors do in Schema

Schema is the main beginner-friendly contribution path.

You pick an app category and define how context should work there.

Good category examples:

- music
- video-streaming
- shopping
- learning
- travel
- food-delivery
- news-articles
- creator-tools
- productivity
- AI assistants

For each category, add:

- useful context fields
- raw app input examples
- normalized output examples
- user-facing Wiki entry templates
- fields that need extra care
- category-level permission suggestions
- basic tests

Do not build random features. Keep the PR focused on one category.

## What a good schema should do

A good schema should turn messy app activity into clear user-facing context.

It should separate:

- stable preferences from temporary intent
- explicit user choices from weak app guesses
- useful summaries from raw private data
- safe personalization context from sensitive inference

Bad:

```text
User is anxious because they watched productivity videos at night.
```

Better:

```text
Often watches productivity videos in the evening.
```

Best, after user edit:

```text
I prefer productivity content in the evening, especially short practical videos.
```

## Parts of Memact

- Access handles consent, apps, API keys, scopes, and permissions.
- Wiki is where users add, edit, approve, reject, delete, and share context.
- Schema defines app category schemas.
- Memory stores accepted context, history, retrieval, and app-safe summaries.
- Contracts defines shared shapes and validators.
- SDK helps apps connect to Memact.
- Website is the user and developer portal.

## Rules

- Apps propose context. Users control what becomes memory.
- Default visibility should be private.
- Apps should not get full Wiki access.
- Apps should only get relevant category context with permission.
- User-added context is stronger than app-proposed context.
- Important app writes should require approval.
- Prefer readable summaries over raw personal data.
- Do not infer sensitive traits.
- Do not write fake certainty.
- Keep user-facing copy simple.
- Do not bring back Capture, Inference, or Intent as current product language.

## Contribution path

Start with an issue labeled:

- `SSoC26`
- `Easy`
- `good first issue`
- `schema`

Comment before starting so work does not get duplicated.

Run checks before opening a PR:

```powershell
npm install
npm run check
```

Keep the first PR small. One category, clear examples, basic tests.

## Best explanation

Memact lets users see, edit, and control the app-generated version of themselves.

Apps bring context. Categories organize it. Wiki keeps the user in charge.
